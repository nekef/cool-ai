The provided shell script serves as a basic artificial intelligence simulation, engaging in a simple
conversation with the user. Upon execution, the script welcomes the user and initiates a loop where it
continuously prompts the user for input. The user's responses are echoed back by the AI, creating a back-and-forth dialogue.
The script includes a termination condition, allowing the user to type "exit" to conclude the interaction. Designed for simplicity, this
script serves as a foundation for more complex conversational AI implementations in the shell scripting environment. Users can gain insights
into basic input handling and conditional statements within a shell script while experiencing a rudimentary interaction with the AI.
